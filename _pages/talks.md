Here ares some of my talks: 

#### [Software Development in the Age of Breaches](https://www.slideshare.net/KarthikBhat17/software-development-in-the-age-of-breaches)

98% of the attacks against applications are opportunistic. This means, vast majority of these attacks could be prevented by simply following "Defense Driven Development" methodology. A variant of Test Driven Development, this methodology puts emphasis on early detection, automation, and defensive coding styles. This presentation talks about what it is like to adopt Defense Driven Development.

#### [Encryption in the Age of Breaches](https://www.slideshare.net/KarthikBhat17/encryption-in-the-age-of-breaches)

This talk focuses on various encryption technologies available to Application Developers to protect sensitive data. Encrypting data at different layers addresses different attack vectors.

#### [Making case for Encrypted Identities](https://www.slideshare.net/KarthikBhat17/making-case-for-encrypted-identities)

Customer Identity Data is the most important data any organization stores. Yet, this information is stored, processed and managed in clear text making it easy for attackers to compromise this data. This presentation makes case for storing Identity data encrypted in order to significantly reduce the attack surface.
