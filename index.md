Hi, my name is Karthik Bhat. I am a technologist, developer and engineering leader. I help conceptualize, build and launch products in InfoSec, Privacy, Identity and CyberSecurity space. 

### Current Work
I help build Passwordless Identity ecosystem @ Okta. I lead Okta's Devices Platform team that enables high-assurance, cryptographically bound Device based Identity system.

* Check out (Okta FastPass)[https://www.okta.com/fastpass/]

### Past Work 1
I led teams that built these technologies:

* [Trusted Data Format (TDF)](https://github.com/virtru/tdf3-spec) : Open, Interoperable, data format for encrypting and protecting sensitive objects (such as files or emails). The latest version of TDF is TDF3. Check out its [capabilities](https://github.com/virtru/tdf3-spec#features-and-capabilities).

* [Virtru Developer Platform](https://developer.virtru.com): Enables developers to build privacy centric applications from ground-up. Check out [demo apps](https://developer.virtru.com/docs/demo) and [SDKs](https://developer.virtru.com/docs/sdk). Protected content is stored as a `TDF`.

* [Virtru Network Protection Gateways](https://www.virtru.com/saas-application-encryption/): Enables Enterprises and SaaS Applications to protect sensitive content. 


### Past Work 2

* I co-founded a company to make it easy for developers and enterprises to encrypt, protect and manage [customer Identity data](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/world-needs-encrypted-identity-manager-now-karthik-bhat/).
* Based on the tech outlined in this [RepoSe system (Part 1)](https://github.com/karthikbhat/RepoSe/blob/master/RepoSe_Paper.pdf) whitepaper.
